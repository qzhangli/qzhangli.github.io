Abstract:
* We developed a machine-learning algorithm which reliably places anthropological landmarks on unilateral cleft-lip pictures in order to guide intraoperative markings. We utilized High-Resolution Net (HRNet), a recent family of deep learning models that has achieved state of the art results in many computer-vision tasks, including facial landmark detection. For model evaluation, we calculated error using the Normalized Mean Error (NME), an evaluation metric in facial landmark detection. Our results illustrate the possibility of leveraging relatively small amounts of data to achieve surprisingly accurate labeling in cleft-lip annotations. In the future, we plan on physically projecting these markings onto the surface of cleft-lips, using technology developed by our team, thereby overcoming discrepancies related to paper to 3-dimensional marking
