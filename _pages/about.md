I am currently a final year computer science student at University of California, Irvine. \n
As an undergraduate at UCI, I studied computer science with a concentration on intelligent systems. I have several research experiences in computer vision, which aroused my interest in computer vision. I hope to continue exploring this field of study as a graduate student.
More info about me can be found in [my CV](https://qzhangli.github.io/cv/).
